        <td>Lilo Pelekai is a small, cute Hawaiian girl with long, black hair, and almond-shaped brown eyes. She is most often seen wearing a red "muumuu" with white leaf patterns all over it. She lives with her older sister Nani. She is a main character in  the movie "Lilo & Stitch," and you could say she's free-spirited and unique.
        </td>
        <td>Lilo is a symbolism of the struggles of orphaned children. Throughout the movie, she faces citiques because of her circumstance that she cannot control. She serves as a comfort character for those who are like her (at the start of the movie), not alone, but lonely.
